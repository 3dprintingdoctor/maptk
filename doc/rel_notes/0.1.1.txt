MAPTK v0.1.1 Release Notes
==========================

This release provides patches to the MAPTK v0.1.0 release to address issues.
MAPTK v0.1.1 is primarily a bug fix release with very minimal new functionality.


Updates since v0.1.0
--------------------

Core Library

 * Completed the implementation of the landmark class, fixed compiler errors,
   and provided template instantiations so that it is compiled.

 * Added a non-templated base class landmark with a double precision interface
   that mirrors the approach used in the feature class.


Fixes since v0.1.0
------------------

Core Library

 * Fixed bug in function maptk::local_geo_cs::update_ins_data(). Was not
   using reference coordinate UTM zone.

Documentation

 * fixed some documentation of the landmark class that was mistakenly using
   the name feature.

 * Enabled dependency between modules in Doxygen so that Doxygen generated
   documentation for add-on modules can refer to the documentation in core.

Warnings / Errors

  * Fixed various gcc compiler warnings (GCC 4.7.7)
