MAPTK v0.1.2 Release Notes
==========================

This release provides patches to the MAPTK v0.1.1 release to address issues.
MAPTK v0.1.2 is primarily a bug fix release with minimal new functionality.


Updates since v0.1.1
--------------------

CMake

 * Added compiler specific flag settings structures, with initial, basic GCC
   and MSVC flags.

 * Added addition of position-independent code flag when building statically.

 * Build shared by default on Windows (no support yet for static Windows
   builds).


Fixes since v0.1.1
------------------

CMake

 * Corrected ``MAKE_<module>_LIB`` flag typo bug in target utils.

Core Library

 * New minimum requirement for Boost: 1.46.1. This is enforced in the
   CMakeLists.txt when finding Boost.

 * Fixed grammar for configuration file parsing to be compatible for Boost
   1.46.1 and above.

 * Fixed and added use of export flags to resolve and support DLL compilation
   on Windows.

OpenCV Library

 * Added use of export flags to resolve and support DLL compilation on
   Windows.

Proj Library

 * Added use of export flags to resolve and support DLL compilation on
   Windows.

VXL Library

 * Added use of export flags to resolve and support DLL compilation on
   Windows.

Tests

 * Added parentheses around arguments to test macros in test_common.h.
   This allows arguments to be expressions, like "a > 0.0", without
   interfering with the stream operators.

 * Increased the tolerance on the homography estimation noisy points test.
   It was failing randomly because the error was just over the tolerance.
