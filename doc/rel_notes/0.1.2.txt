MAPTK v0.1.2 Release Notes
==========================

This release provides patches to the MAPTK v0.1.1 release to address issues.
MAPTK v0.1.2 is primarily a bug fix release with minimal new functionality.


Fixes since v0.1.1
------------------

Core Library

 * New minimum requirement for Boost: 1.46.1. This is enforced in the
   CMakeLists.txt when finding Boost.

 * Fixed grammar for configuration file parsing to be compatible for Boost
   1.46.1 and above.

Tests

 * Increased the tolerence on the homogaphy estimation noisy points test.
   It was failing randomly because the error was just over the tolerence.
