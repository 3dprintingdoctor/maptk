MAP-Tk v0.10.0 Release Notes
============================

This is a minor release of MAP-Tk that provides both new functionality and
fixes over the previous v0.9.0 release.  This release introduces another big
refactoring of the MAP-Tk code base.  MAP-Tk now builds against KWIVER instead
of the stand-along Vital repository.  Vital has moved into KWIVER and the stand
alone Vital repository is discontinued.  All of the plugins previously located
in MAP-Tk have also moved into KWIVER.  The plugins are now called "arrows".
That leaves this project, MAP-Tk, with a collection of tools and scripts for
photogrammetry.  MAP-Tk no longer a toolkit.  The toolkit has become KWIVER.
MAP-Tk is the collection of photogrammetry tools built on KWIVER.  As such,
we may rebrand MAP-Tk in a future release to make this more clear.


Updates since v0.9.0
--------------------

Core Plugin

 * Added an option to the PCA canonical transform estimator to shift the ground
   plane vertically to place a configurable percentile of the landmarks above
   the ground.

Scripts

 * In the SketchUp import plugin allow the user to select how many frames to
   use if there are more than 10 available.

Tools

 * Updated all tools to use the new plugin loading framework from KWIVER.

 * Added python version of track features tool.

 * The maptk_bundle_adjust_tracks tool now has a configuration option to write
   out the geographic coordinates of the local coordinate system origin.  Also
   this same option can be used to read an origin location in to specify the
   origin point manually.

 * Added a tool to apply ground control points to transform the coordinate system
   without running bundle adjustment.

Visualization Application

 * Updated the GUI to use the new plugin loading framework from KWIVER.

 * Extended the tool framework in the GUI to handle callbacks from the tools
   to allow some tools to provide updated visualization of intermediate results
   while they are still running.  Also extended the tool framework to allow
   creatiion of new cameras and landmarks, not just update existing ones.

 * Added a cancel option for GUI computation tools which run for a long time
   and use callbacks to provide updates.  The cancel button allows for early
   termination of those tools.

 * Add visualization of intermediate results of the bundle adjustment tool
   using a callback.

 * Added a camera and landmark initialization tool that creates cameras
   and landmarks starting with just tracks. It uses callbacks to show
   intermediate results.

 * Added an icon in the GUI for the depth map.

 * Added specialized vtk filters for efficiently processing the depth map for
   display in both the WorldView and DepthMapView.

 * Switched DepthMapView display representation to points instead of polygons;
   it renders much faster and is indistinguishable for sufficiently large point
   size. The '+' and '-' keys can be used to increase and decrease,
   respectively, the point size of the depth map in both the WorldView and
   DepthMapView; the point size of each display is controlled independently
   based on focus.


Fixes since v0.9.0
------------------

Visualization Application

 * Removed duplicate loading and filtering of depth maps between the World view
   and Depth Map view.  This makes it twice as fast.

 * Fixed a bug where depth map loading was printing an error message about not
   being able to load "" when there is no depth map on the first frame.

 * Fixed a bug where the depth map view bounds were not properly set when
   loading the first depth map after the first frame.
