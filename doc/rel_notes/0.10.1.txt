Build System

 * The CPack installer packaging was broken on MacOS due to using the variable
   CMAKE_SHARED_LIBRARY_SUFFIX instead of CMAKE_SHARED_MODULE_SUFFIX to find
   KWIVER plugins to include in the package.  These variables are the same on
   most platforms but differ on MacOS where libraries are .dylib and modules
   are .so.
