MAP-Tk v0.11.0 Release Notes
============================

This is a minor release of MAP-Tk that provides both new functionality and
fixes over the previous v0.10.0 release.


Updates since v0.10.0
--------------------

Main Library

 * Updated all functions to use the new feature_track_set class and
   feature_track_state class from KWIVER.

Tools

 * Updated all tools to use the new feature_track_set class and
   feature_track_state class from KWIVER.

TeleSculptor Application

 * Updated the application to use the new feature_track_set class and
   feature_track_state class from KWIVER.


Fixes since v0.10.0
------------------

Tests

 * All of the unit tests in v0.10.0 were testing functions that had moved
   into KWIVER.  Those tests had also been duplicated in KWIVER, so the
   redundant tests in MAP-Tk were removed.  This leaves MAP-Tk with no tests.
   New tests, especially for the command line tools, should be added in the
   future.
