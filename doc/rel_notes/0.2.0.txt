MAPTK v0.2.0 Release Notes
==========================

This is a minor release MAPTK that provides both new functionality and fixes
over the previous v0.1.2 release.


Updates since v0.1.2
--------------------

Core

 * Applied the "abstract base class, templated derived class" pattern to the
   camera class.  The same pattern had been used for features and landmarks.
   It allows a camera to be implemented in either double or float but
   maintain a type-agnostic interface through a common base class.

 * Added type conversion for rotation, camera, and camera_intrinsics
   (e.g. cast rotation_<double> to rotation_<float>).

 * Added a look_at() member function to the camera_ class to set the camera
   rotation such that the camera looks at a specified point and has an up
   direction aligned with the specified scene up direction.
   Unit tests provided.

 * Added map() and unmap() member functions to camera_intrinsics to apply
   and undo the camera intrinsic mapping as 2D-2D transformation.  Also can
   map 3D points in normalized camera coordinates to 2D image coordinates.
   Unit tests provided.

 * Added project() member function to the camera_ class project 3D points to
   2D image points by applying both extrinsic and intrinsic parameters.
   Unit tests provided.

 * Added a magnitude() member and normalized() function for the vector class.

 * Added a vector_<T> constructor from a raw array of data (const T*)

 * Added a matrix_<T> member functions to set and extract rows and columns.

 * Added a matrix_<T> member function to update a sub-matrix.


Fixes since v0.1.2
------------------

Core

 * Fixed typo in variable name in camera_ constructor (intrincs --> intrinsics)
