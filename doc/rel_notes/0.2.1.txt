MAPTK v0.2.1 Release Notes
==========================

Minor patch release since v0.2.0 containing bug fixes and small improvements.


Updates since v0.2.0
--------------------

OpenCV

 * Added test exposing OpenCV bug/error on Windows. Single test expected to
   fail on windows until this is resolved within OpenCV or we have a
   workaround.

Tools

 * Added support in SBA tool to handle a sparse set of POS files (missing POS
   files for frames).

 * Improved error reprting when checking configuration in SBA tool.


Fixes since v0.2.0
------------------

OpenCV

 * Changed OCV detect_features default nested algorithm from GridSURF to SURF.
   Windows has an issue with GridSURF and its nested algorithm.

Tools

 * SBA tool now outputs POS and KRTD files that have same filename stem as the
   source frames they are associated with.
