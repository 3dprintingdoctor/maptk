MAPTK v0.3.0 Release Notes
==========================


Updates since v0.2.1
--------------------

Core Library

 * Added abstract algorithms for triangulation of landmarks.

 * Added function to extract a sub-matrix from a matrix

 * Added functions to extract and update a sub-vector from a vector

 * Added functions to compute determinants of 2x2 and 3x3 matrices.

 * Added a class to represent a similarity transformation (scale, rotation,
   and translation).

 * Added clone() functions to camera and landmark.

 * Add transform() functions to apply similarity transformations to landmarks,
   cameras, covariances, and maps of cameras and landmarks.

 * Added a templated set_value function to config_block to allow setting values
   directly without first needing a boost::lexical_cast.

 * Added "yes" and "no" as value boolean configuration strings

 * Replaced track_features_simple with track_features_default class,
   requiring any config file to change this value from "simple" to "default".

 * Added algorithm definition for similarity transformation estimation.

 * Added several helper functions to track_set class.

VXL Library

 * Added implementation of triangulation of landmarks algorithm using vpgl.

 * Added similarity transformation estimation implementation using
   vgl_compute_similarity_3d.

Tests

 * Factored out some reuseable test functions into common header files.

 * Added tests for VXL similarity transform estimation

Tools

 * When loading POS files in the bundle_adjust_tracks tools, triangulate to
   compute initial landmark positions.
