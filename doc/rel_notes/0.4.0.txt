MAPTK v0.4.0 Release Notes
==========================


Updates since v0.3.0
--------------------

Core Library

  * Added interpolation functions for rotations and for cameras.

  * Added camera optimization algorithm definition.

  * Added hierarchical SBA algorithm definition and generic implementation.

  * Added method for loading landmark and track structures from a geographic
    reference point file.

  * Added a few homography classes for storing transformations between
    two frames or two arbitrary coordinate systems.

  * Added a class to estimate an arbitrary current to reference frame
    homography for a given sequence of input data.

  * Modified the match_features_homography class to optionally not output
    any matches if certain criteria are met. This is disabled by default.

  * Added a new math exceptions for matrix related operations.

VXL Library

  * Added VXL implementation of camera optimization

  * Added a VXL loop closure implementation based around using reference
    frame homographies to estimate when we have reached the same location
    again, and to additionally determine the most optimal frames to perform
    feature matching between.

OpenCV Library

  * Added more options to the draw_track class, including the ability
    to compare computed features tracks and landmarks projected onto
    the image using camera krtd files.

Tools

  * Added reference point file input option and functionality to bundle adjust
    tool. This allows a user-generated 3D-2D point corrolation list to drive
    post-SBA world coordinate transformation instead of, or in the absence of
    input POS camera files.

Tests

  * Added tests for VXL camera optimization implementation

  * Added methods for vector and matrix aproximate equality


Fixes since v0.3.0
------------------

VXL Library

  * Changed underlying VXL function used in similarity transformation
    estimation algorithm to improve algorithm accuracy.

  * Remove landmarks that triangulate behind any of the cameras.
    These erroneous triangulations were causing large SBA errors.
