MAPTK v0.4.0 Release Notes
==========================


Updates since v0.3.0
--------------------

Core Library

  * Added interpolation functions for rotations and for cameras.

  * Added camera optimization algorithm definition.

  * Added hierarchical SBA algorithm definition and generic implementation.

  * Added method for loading landmark and track structures from a geographic
    reference point file.

VXL Library

  * Added VXL implementation of camera optimization

OpenCV Library

  * Added more options to the draw_track class, including the ability
    to compare computed features tracks and landmarks projected onto
    the image using camera krtd files.

Tools

  * Added reference point file input option and functionality to bundle adjust
    tool. This allows a user-generated 3D-2D point corrolation list to drive
    post-SBA world coordinate transformation instead of, or in the absence of
    input POS camera files.

Tests

  * Added tests for VXL camera optimization implementation

  * Added methods for vector and matrix aproximate equality


Fixes since v0.3.0
------------------

VXL Library

  * Changed underlying VXL function used in similarity transformation
    estimation algorithm to improve algorithm accuracy.
