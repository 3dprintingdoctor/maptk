MAPTK v0.4.1 Release Notes
==========================

This release provides patches to the MAPTK v0.4.0 release to address issues.
MAPTK v0.4.1 is primarily a bug fix release with very minimal new functionality.


Updates since v0.4.0
--------------------

Documentation

 * Renamed README to README.md to allow GitHub to pick up on markdown formatting

 * Added a more detailed project description to README.md

 * Added a class index to the Doxygen output

Build System

 * Updated the dashboard_git_url in the dashboard scripts to point to the
   new public git URL on GitHub.

Core Library

 * Added "virtual" keyword to algo type_name() and impl_name() methods in
   derived classes.  The keyword is not required here, but makes it more
   apparent that these are virtual methods.

 * Made destructor for compute_ref_homography_default class virtual.


Fixes since v0.4.0
------------------

Build System

 * Added missing include directory path in CMake for PROJ

 * Fixed the find module procedure for PROJ to work with
   newer versions of CMake

 * Fixed the issue with building statically on Windows by applying
   __declspec(dllimport) only in the shared build case.

Core Library

 * Call loop closure on the first frame in the default tracker to fix
   off-by-one bug in the loop closure reference frame and resulting
   homography file.

OpenCV Library

 * Fixed crash caused by a NULL info structure returned by
   cv::Algorithm::info().  Must check that the info object is not NULL
   before calling its name() method.
