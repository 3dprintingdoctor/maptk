==========================

This is a minor release of MAPTK that provides both new functionality and fixes
over the previous v0.4.1 release.


Updates since v0.4.1
--------------------

Core Library

 * Added abstract algorithm for essential matrix estimation from feature matches
   and known camera intrinsics.

 * Added a function to create a cross-product matrix (3x3, skew symmetric) from
   a 3D vector.

VXL Library

 * Added concrete implementaiton of essential matrix estimation using the
   vpgl_em_compute_5_point_ransac class in VXL.

 * Refactored maptk <--> VXL camera conversion functions to expose conversion
   functions for the camera calibration matrices (camera intrinsics).

Tests

 * Added various unit tests for VXL estimate_essential_matrix.
