MAPTK v0.5.0 Release Notes
==========================

This is a minor release of MAPTK that provides both new functionality and fixes
over the previous v0.4.1 release.


Updates since v0.4.1
--------------------

Core Library

 * Added abstract algorithm for essential matrix estimation from feature matches
   and known camera intrinsics.

 * Added a function to create a cross-product matrix (3x3, skew symmetric) from
   a 3D vector.

 * Added a function, canonical_tranform(), to estimate a canonical similarity
   transformation given a collection of cameras and landmarks.  The
   transformation aligns the mean of landmarks with the origin, scales to give
   the landmark distribution unit variance, and aligns the orientation with the
   average camera look direction.

VXL Library

 * Added concrete implementaiton of essential matrix estimation using the
   vpgl_em_compute_5_point_ransac class in VXL.

 * Refactored maptk <--> VXL camera conversion functions to expose conversion
   functions for the camera calibration matrices (camera intrinsics).

Tests

 * Added various unit tests for VXL estimate_essential_matrix.

Tools

 * Updated the bundle adjustment tool to apply the canonical similarity
   transform in the absence of any other global coordinate constraints.
   This fixes the coordinates after guage-free optimization to allow results
   to be more easily compared.
