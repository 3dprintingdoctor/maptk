Fixes since v0.6.0
------------------

Build System

 * Properly honor EIGEN3_ROOT if set when finding the Eigen package.
   This allows CMake super builds to specify which Eigen MAP-Tk should build
   against.

MAP-Tk Library

 * Fixed a bug in the camera_<T> type casting constructor that was causing some
   member variables to not be copied and cast.  Added a regression test to
   catch this issue.

Tests

 * Fixed a bug in the noisy_landmarks helper function, which adds random noise
   to landmark locations for use in unit tests.  The function previously had a
   side effect of modifying the source landmarks in place.  This has been
   corrected by cloning landmarks before modification.
