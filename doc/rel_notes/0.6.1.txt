Fixes since v0.6.0
------------------

Build System

 * Properly honor EIGEN3_ROOT if set when finding the Eigen package.
   This allows CMake super builds to specify which Eigen MAP-Tk should build
   against.

 * Fixed some issues with the default Visual Studio compiler flags that were
   causing CMake to hang during VS2013 compiler tests.

MAP-Tk Library

 * Fixed a bug in the camera_<T> type casting constructor that was causing some
   member variables to not be copied and cast.  Added a regression test to
   catch this issue.

Tools

 * Fixed a compile failure on some systems due to passing the base camera by
   value in the pos2krtd tool.

 * Fixed an issue in the track_feature tool where when using a mask file it
   was throwing an error if the file exists, not when it was missing.

Tests

 * Fixed a bug in the noisy_landmarks helper function, which adds random noise
   to landmark locations for use in unit tests.  The function previously had a
   side effect of modifying the source landmarks in place.  This has been
   corrected by cloning landmarks before modification.
