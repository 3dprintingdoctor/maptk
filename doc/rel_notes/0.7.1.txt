MAPTK v0.7.1 Release Notes
==========================

This release provides patches to the MAPTK v0.7.0 release to add CPack
packaging support.  MAPTK v0.7.1 provides only CMake improvements and
installer support files to help build distributable packages and installers.


Updates since v0.7.0
--------------------

Build System

 * Added support for packaging with CPack.  On Windows this will build an
   installer executable (using NSIS).  On Mac OS X it will build a disk image
   containing an application bundle.  On Linux it will create a self extracting
   TGZ file.  The focus in this release is on packaging the graphical
   application; however, command line utilities and headers are included as
   well.

Visualization Application

 * Added larger versions of the application icon and specialized icon formats
   for Windows (.ico) and Mac (.icns).
