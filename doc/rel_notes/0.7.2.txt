Fixes since v0.7.1
------------------

Build System

* Update CMake code to create packaging bundle that contains all
  plugins and dependent libraries. The resulting package will contain
  all necessary libraies other than system libraries.

* Add CMake option to specify an optional single directory for the
  algorithm plugin manager to search for plugins. This allows packages
  to be built that have a search path established relative to the final
  install location.

 * Updated the sample config files so that they are compatible with the current
   version of the code.
