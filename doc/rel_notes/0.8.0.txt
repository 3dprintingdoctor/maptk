MAP-Tk v0.8.0 Release Notes
==========================

This is a minor release of MAP-Tk that provides both new functionality and
fixes over the previous v0.7.2 release.


Updates since v0.7.2
---------------------------------

Main Library

 * Moved a large number of core data types and abstract algorithms to a
   new dependent project name VITAL.  VITAL will provide a common framework
   for logging, configuration, and core data types to be shared across
   KWIVER projects.

 * Changed the camera and camera_intrinsic classes to act as higher level
   containers.  Each now has an abstract base class and a "simple" concrete
   class.  The templated derived classes (e.g. camera_<T>) have been removed.
   The simple classes use the double type internally.

 * Changed the camera to contain a shared pointer to a camera_intrinsics
   object rather than an instance.  This allows cameras to share common
   intrinsics.

 * Moved some common functions like project() and depth() into the camera
   base class to allow usage without down-casting.

Ceres Plugin

 * Added an option to the bundle adjust algorithm to control how camera
   intrinsics are shared across cameras.  The default auto sharing mode
   optimizes a seperate set of intrinsics for each camera_intrinsics object
   shared amongst the cameras.  Additional options allow forcing each camera
   to have its own independent intrinsics and forcing all cameras share
   one common set of intrinsics.

Fixes since v0.7.2
-------------------------------

OpenCV Plugin

 * Fixed an issue with some parameters to draw_tracks and analyze_tracks
   in which the get_configuration function was always returning the default
   parameters, even after other values were set.
