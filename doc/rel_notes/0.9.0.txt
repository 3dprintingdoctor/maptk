MAP-Tk v0.9.0 Release Notes
==========================

This is a minor release of MAP-Tk that provides both new functionality and
fixes over the previous v0.8.0 release.  However, MAP-Tk is still considered
pre-release software and subject to significant API changes.


Updates since v0.8.0
---------------------------------

MAP-Tk Library

 * Removed the standalone canonical_transform() function in transform.h in
   favor of an abstract algorithm with implementation in the core plugin.

Core Plugin

 * Added a new algorithm for canonical transform with the implementation
   details moved from the function that was in transform.h.

 * Added a new loop closure algorithm implementation that searches for
   matches in a local neighborhood and then establishes keyframes for
   long term loop closure outside that neighborhood.  This algorithm
   is generally slower than others, but can be configured to produce
   considerably more dense match matrices with longer tracks.  It also handles
   long term loop closure without any assumption about planar scenes.

Visualization Application

 * Updated the "Align" tool to use the configurable abstract algorithm
   for canonical transform.

Tools

 * Updated the bundle_adjust_tracks tool to use the configurable abstract
   algorithm for canonical transform.


Fixes since v0.8.0
