MAP-Tk v0.9.1 is a bug fix release with no new functionality.


Fixes since v0.9.0
--------------------

Ceres Plugin

 * Fixed an assertion from Ceres that caused program termination due to adding
   constraints on camera intrinsics that were not used in the optimization.
   We now keep track of which intrinsics are used and only constrain those.
   The error message was:
   "problem_impl.cc:65 Check failed: it != parameter_map.end() Parameter block not found"
