MAP-Tk v0.9.1 Release Notes
===========================

This release provides patches to the MAP-Tk v0.9.0 release to address issues.
MAP-Tk v0.9.1 is a bug fix release with no new functionality.


Fixes since v0.9.0
--------------------

Core Plugin

 * In the core initialize_cameras_landmarks algorithm the config parameter
   "final_reproj_thresh" was being initialized to with the value of
   "interim_reproj_thresh", which could lead to setting the value incorrectly.

Ceres Plugin

 * Fixed an assertion from Ceres that caused program termination due to adding
   constraints on camera intrinsics that were not used in the optimization.
   We now keep track of which intrinsics are used and only constrain those.
   The error message was:
   "problem_impl.cc:65 Check failed: it != parameter_map.end() Parameter block not found"
