MAP-Tk v0.9.1 Release Notes
===========================

This release provides patches to the MAP-Tk v0.9.0 release to address issues.
MAP-Tk v0.9.1 is a bug fix release with no new functionality.


Fixes since v0.9.0
--------------------

Core Plugin

 * In the core initialize_cameras_landmarks algorithm the config parameter
   "final_reproj_thresh" was being initialized to with the value of
   "interim_reproj_thresh", which could lead to setting the value incorrectly.

Ceres Plugin

 * Fixed an assertion from Ceres that caused program termination due to adding
   constraints on camera intrinsics that were not used in the optimization.
   We now keep track of which intrinsics are used and only constrain those.
   The error message was:
   "problem_impl.cc:65 Check failed: it != parameter_map.end() Parameter block not found"

Tools

 * The estimate_homography tool had some hard coded default configuration
   values to use OpenCV algorithms.  These default configuration values were
   not updated when the OpenCV plugin was restructured making the default
   values invalid.  These defaults have been corrected to match the current
   OpenCV configuration variable names.

Visualization Application

 * Fixed a copy/paste error in the AbstractTool class.  If landmarks were Null
   it was updating the cameras with Null, not the landmarks.
