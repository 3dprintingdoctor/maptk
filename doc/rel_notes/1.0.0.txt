MAPTK v1.0.0 Release Notes
==========================

This is a major release of MAPTK that provides both new functionality and fixes
over the previous v0.5.0 release.


Updates since v0.5.0
--------------------

Build System

 * Revised module system into providing tools to build library and plugins for
   dynamic loading.

 * Added install rules for CMake utilities for MAPTK users to create MAPTK
   complient plugin interface libraries.

 * Added FindEigen3 CMake module and call it to find Eigen, which is now a
   required dependency.

MAPTK Library / Core Plugin

 * Added plugin support for loading externally defined algorithm
   implementations.

 * Refactored source file layout.

 * Separated out algorithm implementations that used to be in the main MAPTK
   library into a core libraray witha a plugin interface.

 * Added required dependency on the Eigen3 header-only library.  Going forward
   Eigen will provide standardized linear algebra functionality so we do not
   waste effort duplicating linear algebra code in MAP-Tk.

 * Replaced maptk::matrix_<M,N,T> with Eigen::Matrix<T,M,N>

 * Replaced maptk::vector_<N,T> with Eigen::Matrix<T,N,1>

 * Removed vector_2_<T>, vector_3_<T>, and vector_4_<T> sub-classes

 * Added missing operator>> for Eigen::Matrix<T,M,N>

 * Changed internal quaternion vector in maptk::rotation_<T> to use
   Eigen::Quaternion<T> and replaced most of the calculations with those
   provided by Eigen::Quaternion<T> member functions.

OCV Plugin

 * Converted module library into a library-plugin pair.

PROJ Plugin

 * Converted module library into a library-plugin pair.

VisCL Plugin

 * Converted module library into a library-plugin pair.

VXL Plugin

 * Converted module library into a library-plugin pair.

Tests

 * Refactored test code to reference correct libraries and use new plugin
   loading and management where required.
