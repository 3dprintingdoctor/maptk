MAPTK Release Notes for changes pending release approval by AFRL
================================================================

This file documents release notes for changes made to MAPTK which require
public release approval from AFRL.  After approval, the changes and
corresponding notes below will be encorporated into a public numbered
release version, and the content of this file will be reset.


Updates since last public release
---------------------------------

Build System

 * Separated out plugin management into separate library in order to allow for
   static plugin library linking for static builds, preventing a non-
   deterministic issue with dynamically loading static libraries causing
   duplicated symbols.

 * Simplified string logic for finding compiler flags file.

 * Added Eigen3 include directory path to include directories exported by MAPTK

Core Library

 * Revised homography structures into objects that contain, rather than
   subclass, Eigen::Matrix.

 * Revised import/export logic in auto-generated plugin library code.

 * Redefined algorithm registration to allow for overwriting by label.

 * Added informative debugging messages to allow for plugin implementation
   tracing.

 * Added C and Python interfaces. These wrappers are currently incomplete but
   offer an introduction into what they will look like and how they will
   function.

 * Added constructor from base class for feature_<T>.

 * Added abstract base class for algorithm to filter a set of features
   (filter_features).

Core Plugin

 * Updated compute_ref_homog algorithm to allow additional constraints
   (minimum inliers, reference frame [non]regression)

 * Added concrete algorithm to filter a feature set by magnitude of detector
   response (filter_features_magnitude).

 * Updated match_features_homography to allow two-pass feature matching with
   (potentially) different matchers, a feature filter applied during the
   first pass, and homography warping applied between the matchers.

VXL Plugin

 * Added a geometrically constrained feature matcher
   (match_features_constrained) that uses a search radius on feature location
   (and optionally scale and orientation) to limit search for matches.

Fixes since last public release
-------------------------------

Build System

 * Changed target property getter function to one that is not currently subject
   to a regression bug.

 * Fixed compile definitions used for building static algo plugin
   registration.

Core Plugin

 * Added missing header to source list

 * Fixed import/export macro definition variable spelling.
