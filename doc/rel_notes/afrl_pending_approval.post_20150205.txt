================================================================

This file documents release notes for changes made to MAPTK which require
public release approval from AFRL.  After approval, the changes and
corresponding notes below will be encorporated into a public numbered
release version, and the content of this file will be reset.


Updates since last public release
---------------------------------

Build System

 * Separated out plugin management into separate library in order to allow for
   static plugin library linking for static builds, preventing a non-
   deterministic issue with dynamically loading static libraries causing
   duplicated symbols.

 * Simplified string logic for finding compiler flags file.

Main Library

 * Revised import/export logic in auto-generated plugin library code.


Fixes since last public release
-------------------------------

Build System

 * Changed target property getter function to one that is not currently subject
   to a regression bug.

Core Plugin

 * Added missing header to source list

 * Fixed import/export macro definition variable spelling.
