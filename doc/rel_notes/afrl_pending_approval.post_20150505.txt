MAPTK Release Notes for changes pending release approval by AFRL
================================================================

This file documents release notes for changes made to MAPTK which require
public release approval from AFRL.  After approval, the changes and
corresponding notes below will be encorporated into a public numbered
release version, and the content of this file will be reset.


Updates since last public release
---------------------------------

Main Library

 * Added a metric in metrics.h to compute the median reprojection error.
   The median provides a more robust alternative to RMSE and is more useful
   for characterizing error when using robust loss functions.

Ceres Plugin

 * Added a new plugin which uses Google Ceres Solver as a back end for
   optimizations.

 * Added an implementation of the bundle_adjust algorithm using Ceres to
   solve the optimization problem.  This supports access to Ceres options
   via the configuration block and currently supports selection of various
   different solver algorithms and robust loss functions.

 * Added unit tests for the Ceres implementation of bundle_adjust that
   duplicates the same tests used for the VXL back end plus a few additional
   tests focusing on robust estimation.

C Interface

 * Updated algorithm related code to use new functions in algorithm C++ base
   class.

Python Interface

 * Updated algorithm related code to use new algorithm C-interface functions.
