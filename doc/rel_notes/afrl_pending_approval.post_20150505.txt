MAPTK Release Notes for changes pending release approval by AFRL
================================================================

This file documents release notes for changes made to MAPTK which require
public release approval from AFRL.  After approval, the changes and
corresponding notes below will be encorporated into a public numbered
release version, and the content of this file will be reset.


Updates since last public release
---------------------------------

Main Library

 * Added a metric in metrics.h to compute the median reprojection error.
   The median provides a more robust alternative to RMSE and is more useful
   for characterizing error when using robust loss functions.

 * Added lens distortion to the camera_intrinsics class.  The model uses the
   same conventions that OpenCV uses.  The distortion parameter vector
   is compatible between OpenCV and MAP-Tk.

 * Added lens undistortion functions to camera_intrinsics which use the
   Gauss-Newton method to iteratively solve for the inverse of distortion.
   Convergence is fast and more accurate than the implementation in OpenCV.

 * Added reading and writing of lens distortion parameters to the camera
   stream operators and, as a result, to the KRTD file io.

Ceres Plugin

 * Added a new plugin which uses Google Ceres Solver as a back end for
   optimizations.

 * Added an implementation of the bundle_adjust algorithm using Ceres to
   solve the optimization problem.  This supports access to Ceres options
   via the configuration block and currently supports selection of various
   different solver algorithms and robust loss functions.

 * Added unit tests for the Ceres implementation of bundle_adjust that
   duplicates the same tests used for the VXL back end plus a few additional
   tests focusing on robust estimation.

 * Added support to both use and estimate lens distortion parameters in the
   bundle_adjust algorithm using Ceres.  Three different distortion models
   can be selected, each adding additional parameters to the previous model.
   Furthermore, many parameters can be locked in the optimization allowing
   for even more fine-grained selection of model parameter subsets.

 * Added unit tests for Ceres bundle adjustment covering the use and estimation
   of lens distortion paramters.

OpenCV Plugin

 * Added unit tests to verify that the lens distortion functions in MAP-Tk
   produce equal results to those routines in OpenCV.

C Interface

 * Updated algorithm related code to use new functions in algorithm C++ base
   class.

Python Interface

 * Updated algorithm related code to use new algorithm C-interface functions.
