Updates since last public release
---------------------------------

Main Library

 * Renamed the algorithm base class clone() method to base_clone() and added
   a new clone() method at the algorithm_impl level.  These functions are
   identical except the base_clone() method returns a base class algorithm
   shared pointer and the clone() method returns a shared pointer to the
   specific algorithm intermediate base class.


Fixes since last public release
