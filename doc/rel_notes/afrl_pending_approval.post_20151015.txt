MAPTK Release Notes for changes pending release approval by AFRL
================================================================

This file documents release notes for changes made to MAP-Tk which require
public release approval from AFRL.  After approval, the changes and
corresponding notes below will be incorporated into a public numbered
release version, and the content of this file will be reset.


Updates since last public release
---------------------------------

MAP-Tk Library

 * The canonical transform function has been changed to set the orientation
   based on the eigenvector of the landmark point cloud.  The cameras are
   now only used to set the sign of the up vector (Z-axis).

 * The Necker reversal transform was improved so that the residual error
   is now kept low after the transform and the transform is now involutory.
   That is, applying the reversal a second time will return to the previous
   state.

Visualization Application

 * Added ability to execute some computations (for now, computing and applying
   basic transformations, applying bundle adjustment to refine the solution)
   from within the GUI.

 * Added ability to export cameras and landmarks to (respectively) KRTD and PLY
   files.

 * Added ability to visualize locations of corresponding feature points on
   adjacent frames to the camera view. This may be helpful as an additional
   means of visualizing camera motion when there exists a spatial correlation
   between adjacent cameras (e.g. frames extracted from continuous-shot video).

 * Added "match matrix" view, allowing the number of corresponding feature
   points for arbitrary frame pairs to be visualized as a "heat map" with
   various Visualization options.

 * Added ability to load imagery directly, and without requiring that cameras
   are loaded.

 * Added ability to visualize landmarks by "true color" or number of
   observations, when relevant data is available.

 * Added ground plane display to world view.

 * Added ability to view camera frame image, projected to the ground plane, in
   the world view.

 * Added ability to toggle world view between parallel and perspective
   projections, and to reset the rotation of the same to one of several basic
   presets (top, left, etc.).

 * The GUI user manual can now be accessed from within the GUI.

Fixes since last public release
-------------------------------

Visualization Application

 * Several performance bottlenecks that limited the rate at which "slideshow"
   mode could switch frames have been identified and mitigated.

 * Fixed bug where newly loaded landmarks would be visible in the world view
   even if landmarks were disabled.

 * Fixed bug that caused feature tracks to be "misaligned" if a camera could
   not be loaded.
