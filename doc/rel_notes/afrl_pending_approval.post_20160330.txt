Updates since last public release
---------------------------------

OpenCV Plugin

 * Added CMake support for handing and marking the use of OpenCV version >= 3.

 * Overhauled OpenCV algorithm introspection structure. Versions 3.x took away
   the previous ability to introspect algorithm types and parameters,
   requiring, for at least versions 3.x, for there to be manual wrappings of
   each algorithm to be exposed. Removed introspection for any version and
   now have cross-version compatible manual wrappings of all algorithms at
   least present in 3.x that fill the feature detection, descriptor extraction
   and feature matching roles.

Fixes since last public release
