MAPTK Release Notes for changes pending release approval by AFRL
================================================================

This file documents release notes for changes made to MAP-Tk which require
public release approval from AFRL.  After approval, the changes and
corresponding notes below will be incorporated into a public numbered
release version, and the content of this file will be reset.


Updates since last public release
---------------------------------

Core Plugin

 * Added an option to the PCA canonical transform estimator to shift the ground
   plane vertically to place a configurable percentile of the landmarks above
   the ground.

Scripts

 * In the SketchUp import plugin allow the user to select how many frames to
   use if there are more than 10 available.

Tools

 * The maptk_bundle_adjust_tracks tool now has a configuration option to write
   out the geographic coordinates of the local coordinate system origin.  Also
   this same option can be used to read an origin location in to specify the
   origin point manually.

Visualization Application

 * Extended the tool framework in the GUI to handle callbacks from the tools
   to allow some tools to provide updated visualization of intermediate results
   while they are still running.  Also extended the tool framework to allow
   creatiion of new cameras and landmarks, not just update existing ones.

 * Added a cancel option for GUI computation tools which run for a long time
   and use callbacks to provide updates.  The cancel button allows for early
   termination of those tools.

 * Add visualization of intermediate results of the bundle adjustment tool
   using a callback.

 * Added a camera and landmark initialization tool that creates cameras
   and landmarks starting with just tracks. It uses callbacks to show
   intermediate results.

 * Added an icon in the GUI for the depth map.


Fixes since last public release
-------------------------------

Visualization Application

 * Removed duplicate loading and filtering of depth maps between the World view
   and Depth Map view.  This makes it twice as fast.

 * Fixed a bug where depth map loading was printing an error message about not
   being able to load "" when there is no depth map on the first frame.

 * Fixed a bug where the depth map view bounds were not properly set when
   loading the first depth map after the first frame.
