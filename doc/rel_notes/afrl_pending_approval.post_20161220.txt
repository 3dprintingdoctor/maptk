Updates since last public release
---------------------------------


Scripts

 * Added options in the krtd_and_ply_to_homogs.py script to estimate a ground
   plane from the PLY data or use the Z=0 plane when computing homographies.

 * Added an option in the mosaic_images.py script to scale the output image.

 * Improved memory efficiency of mosaic_images.py by avoiding preloading of
   all images.

Tools

 * Updated the maptk_bundle_adjust tool to use the filter_tracks algorithm from
   KWIVER instead of directly applying filters.

Visualization Application

 * Added a "Filter Tracks" tool to the GUI that runs the filter_tracks
   algorithm in KWIVER.  Updated the GUI to properly clear existing tracks
   before adding tracks returned from a tool.
