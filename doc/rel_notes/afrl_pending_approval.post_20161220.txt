MAPTK Release Notes for changes pending release approval by AFRL
================================================================

This file documents release notes for changes made to MAP-Tk which require
public release approval from AFRL.  After approval, the changes and
corresponding notes below will be incorporated into a public numbered
release version, and the content of this file will be reset.


Updates since last public release
---------------------------------

Examples/Configs

 * Updated the example tool configuration files to account for tool changes
   to use the video_input API.

 * Added default config files for video_input algorithms that load from image
   lists, with and without POS files.

 * Refactored core_track_features.conf to make the feature detector/descriptor
   reusable across other configs.

Main Library

 * Removed the ins_data structure for holding POS file data as well as all
   functions for reading and writing POS files.  This is now covered by
   the more general video_metadata structure in KWIVER.

 * Updated all the local_geo_cs functions that used ins_data to use
   video_metadata instead.

Scripts

 * Added options in the krtd_and_ply_to_homogs.py script to estimate a ground
   plane from the PLY data or use the Z=0 plane when computing homographies.

 * Added an option in the mosaic_images.py script to scale the output image and
   another option to estimate the scale of the output to match the scale of the
   input images on average.

 * Improved memory efficiency of mosaic_images.py by avoiding preloading of
   all images.

Tools

 * Updated the maptk_bundle_adjust tool to use the filter_tracks algorithm from
   KWIVER instead of directly applying filters.

 * Added a new detect_and_describe tool that runs feature detection and
   descriptor extraction on each frame and writes the outputs to files
   using the feature_descriptor_io algorithm.

 * Updated all tools to use the video_input API from KWIVER to read both
   images and metadata.  This replaces the custom loops over files in an image
   list.  This change allows tools to run directly on video files (e.g. AVI,
   MPEG) with optional KLV metadata as well as lists of images with optional
   lists of POS metadata files.

Visualization Application

 * Added a "Filter Tracks" tool to the GUI that runs the filter_tracks
   algorithm in KWIVER.  Updated the GUI to properly clear existing tracks
   before adding tracks returned from a tool.

 * Updated the GUI to allow "video_source" as an alternative to
   "image_file_list" when looking for a list of images to load in a project
   config file.  This currently only handles the case where the video source
   is a list of images, but is compatible with the new variable naming in
   tool configuration files.
