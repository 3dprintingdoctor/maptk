MAPTK v0.2.1 Release Notes
==========================

Minor patch release since v0.2.0 containing bug fixes and small improvements.
The primary contributions of this release are proper handling of input and
output file names in the SBA tool (output file names for each frame now match
input file names), and improved Doxygen documentation.  This release documents
all files and classes that were previously missing documentation.


Updates since v0.2.0
--------------------

OpenCV

 * Added test exposing OpenCV bug/error on Windows. Single test expected to
   fail on windows until this is resolved within OpenCV or we have a
   workaround.

Tools

 * Added support in SBA tool to handle a sparse set of POS files (missing POS
   files for frames).

 * Improved error reporting when checking configuration in SBA tool.

Documentation

 * Added missing Doxygen documentation across all libraries by ensuring that
   every file and every class has a documentation string.


Fixes since v0.2.0
------------------

OpenCV

 * Changed OCV detect_features default nested algorithm from GridSURF to SURF.
   Windows has an issue with GridSURF and its nested algorithm.

VXL

 * Cached parameters to vpgl_bundle_adjust so that they are not reset to defaults
   each time a config file is parsed and written back out.

Tools

 * SBA tool now outputs POS and KRTD files that have same filename stem as the
   source frames they are associated with.

Documentation

 * Fixed most Doxygen warnings due to improper syntax in documentation
   comments.
