MAPTK v0.5.1 Release Notes
==========================

This release provides patches to the MAPTK v0.5.0 release to address issues.
MAPTK v0.5.1 is primarily a bug fix release with very minimal new functionality.


Updates since v0.5.0
--------------------

Tests

 * Enabled Travis CI integration by adding a .travis.yml file.  This provides
   continuous integration testing on topic branches.  Travis CI only tests
   on a single platform (currently Ubuntu 12.04), so it does not replace
   nightly CDash testing across multiple platforms.  However, it does
   automatically build topic branches and pull requests that would not be
   tested by CDash.  CDash only tests builds of the master and release
   branches, but does so over a wide array of platforms and build
   configurations.  Thus, Travis CI and CDash are complementary testing
   tools.  Travis CI can help catch some build failures before branches
   are merged.

Tools

 * Added more verbose output in the feature_tracker tool when configuration
   checks fail.  Adopts the same reporting technique used in the
   maptk_bundle_adjust_tracks tool.


Fixes since v0.5.0
------------------

Build System

 * Fixed some CMake configuration warnings.

Documentation

 * Added missing algorithms on the MAP-Tk core Doxygen main page and sorted
   existing algorithms.

 * Added missing documentation on the VXL module Doxygen main page for recently
   added algorithms and containers and sorted the lists.

 * Added missing algorithms on the OCV module Doxygen main page and sorted.

 * Boost chrono is required by Boost timer on all platforms when linking a
   static Boost.

OCV Module

 * Swapped respective returns from width/height getter methods as they were
   previously returning the incorrect values.

 * Draw tracks algorithm would not write images into a directory that did not
   exist and would fail silently.  Now it creates the directory first if
   missing.

VXL Module

 * Fixed a camera conversion test that was failing on some platforms.  Compare
   the camera parameters directly instead of computing a 3x4 projection matrix
   for each and comparing that.  Computing the matrix introduces additional
   floating point precision error which should not be a part of this test.

 * Loosened some tolerances on tests that were failing on some dashboard builds
   with errors just slightly over the test tolerance.

Scripts

 * Fixed Blender import KRTD script to handle image aspect ratios where the
   height is larger than width.  Focal length was being interpreted
   incorrectly.  Also set the rendering image resolution based on the principal
   point to get proper aspect ratio in the camera view.

Tools

 * Avoid a segfault in maptk_bundle_adjust_tracks by checking that there are
   tracks remaining after filtering by minimum length.  Provide an informative
   message and exit cleanly if no tracks remain.
