MAPTK v0.7.2 Release Notes
==========================

This release provides patches to the MAPTK v0.7.1 release to address packaging
issues.  MAPTK v0.7.2 is a bug fix release with no new functionality beyond
packaging support.

The binaries provided with this release should address three issues with the
last release.  First, the sample config files have been updated to match the
current code.  Second, the plugin's dependent libraries that were missing are
now included.  Third, the default install directory has been added to the
plugin search path so plugins can be found.

This binaries for this release are limited in that they must be installed in
the default install location to properly find the plugins.  This issue will be
addressed in v0.8.0 with an environment variable.  For now you must install to:

Windows:   C:\Program Files\MAP-Tk 0.7.2
Mac OS X:  /Applications/MAP-Tk.app
Linux:     /usr/local/

The issue with plugin search path only affects the command line tools.  The
GUI does not use the plugins in this release.


Fixes since v0.7.1
------------------

Build System

* Updated CMake code to create packaging bundle that contains all
  plugins and dependent libraries. The resulting package will contain
  all necessary libraries other than system libraries.  The previous
  release was missing dependent libraries for the plugins.

* Added a MAPTK_FIXUP_BUNDLE_ON_PACKAGE option that allows the user to
  enable or disable the bundle creation that should only be done during
  packaging.  In the last release a standard install on Linux was impossible
  because fixup_bundle copied all the dependent libraries into the install
  bin directory.

* Added the EXTRA_MODULE_PATH CMake variable to specify an optional single
  additional directory for the algorithm plugin manager to search for plugins.
  This allows packages to be built that have a search path established relative
  to the final install location.  The previous release did not contain a valid
  search path and plugins were not found.

Tools

 * Updated the sample config files so that they are compatible with the current
   version of the code.
