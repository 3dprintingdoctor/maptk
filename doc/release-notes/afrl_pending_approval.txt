MAP-Tk Release Notes for changes pending release approval by AFRL
=================================================================

This file documents release notes for changes made to MAP-Tk which require
public release approval from AFRL.  After approval, the changes and
corresponding notes below will be incorporated into a public numbered
release version, and the content of this file will be reset.


Updates since last public release
---------------------------------

Plugins

 * Moved the Blender and SketchUp plugins out of the scripts directory and
   into a top-level plugins directory, added a README, and configured these
   files to be installed.

 * The SketchUp plugin now supports older version of SketchUp
   (back to version 8) and only attempts to load frames which have both an
   image file and camera file available in the project.

TeleSculptor

 * Video files can now be open directly or via a config file into TeleSculptor
   for viewing and processing.

 * Added the concept of a "Project", which is essentially a configuration file
   in a working directory in which algorithms can write results.  The user
   must now create or open a project before running an algorithms.

 * TeleSculptor now depends on Sprokit from KWIVER and adds a new Sprokit
   powered compute tool compute feature tracks using the new KLT feature
   tracker in KWIVER.  The tool also detects key frames in video and uses
   ORB feature detection and matching on the keyframes with bag of words
   frame matching for loop closure.

 * A new tool is available in the compute menu to compute a dense depth
   map on the current frame.  THis uses the new Super3D algorithms in KWIVER.

 * TeleSculptor now supports logging with log4cplus.

 * If an input video has KLV metadata (0601 or 0104) TeleSculptor will now
   parse that metadata and use it to construct initial camera models.  It will
   also use the metadata to set a geographic origin for the project, which is
   written to the project directory.

 * TeleSculptor now has a pair of new tools in the Compute menu to save out
   either keyframes or all frames of video to image files.

 * TeleSculptor now uses a common convention for naming all output files
   supporting a frame of video.  If the input is an image list it uses the
   source image names, if a video it uses video name plus frame number.

 * TeleSculptor now has a new tool for triangulating landmarks.  This is
   useful when cameras are provided (e.g. from metadata), but landmarks are
   not.

 * TeleSculptor now supports loading and processing videos with increasing
   but non contiguous frame numbers.  This may occur when loading a video
   at a reduced frame rate.

 * TeleSculptor now has an option to display only keyframes when playing
   back a video.

 * The compute menu has been rearranged and now has an "Advanced" submenu
   containing tool that are less stable or less commonly used.


Fixes since last public release
-------------------------------

Installer

 * Fixed an issue where required data files for PROJ were not installed.
   This also requires TeleSculptor and the command line tools to set an
   environment variable to tell PROJ where the data is installed.

 * TeleSculptor now catches more algorithm exceptions and turns them into
   warning messages rather than letting the application crash.
