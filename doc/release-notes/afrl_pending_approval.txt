MAP-Tk Release Notes for changes pending release approval by AFRL
=================================================================

This file documents release notes for changes made to MAP-Tk which require
public release approval from AFRL.  After approval, the changes and
corresponding notes below will be incorporated into a public numbered
release version, and the content of this file will be reset.


Updates since last public release
---------------------------------

Plugins

 * Moved the Blender and SketchUp plugins out of the scripts directory and
   into a top-level plugins directory, added a README, and configured these
   files to be installed.

TeleSculptor

 * Video files can now be open directly or via a config file into TeleSculptor
   for viewing and processing.


Fixes since last public release
-------------------------------

Installer

 * Fixed an issue where required data files for PROJ were not installed.
   This also requires TeleSculptor and the command line tools to set an
   environment variable to tell PROJ where the data is installed.
