MAP-Tk Release Notes for changes pending release approval by AFRL
=================================================================

This file documents release notes for changes made to MAP-Tk which require
public release approval from AFRL.  After approval, the changes and
corresponding notes below will be incorporated into a public numbered
release version, and the content of this file will be reset.


Updates since last public release
---------------------------------

TeleSculptor

 * The loop over video frames to extract metadata for camera initialization now
   occurs in a separate thread. This allows the user to interact with the GUI
   and view the video while the camera initialization occurs.

 * The slideshow delay slider has been replaced by a speed slider that controls
   the slideshow playback speed. When the slider is to the far left, slideshow
   speed is 0.25Hz and when to the far right, the slideshow plays without any
   delay between frames.

 * Added separate visibility and color options for display of feature tracks
   that have descriptors and those that do not have descriptors.  This allows
   for visual distinction between KLT tracks (without descriptors) on each
   frame of video and ORB, or similar, tracks (with descriptors) on keyframes.


Fixes since last public release
