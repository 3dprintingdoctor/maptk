MAP-Tk Release Notes for changes pending release approval by AFRL
=================================================================

This file documents release notes for changes made to MAP-Tk which require
public release approval from AFRL.  After approval, the changes and
corresponding notes below will be incorporated into a public numbered
release version, and the content of this file will be reset.


Updates since last public release
---------------------------------

TeleSculptor

 * The loop over video frames to extract metadata for camera initialization now
   occurs in a separate thread. This allows the user to interact with the GUI
   and view the video while the camera initialization occurs.

 * The slideshow delay slider has been replaced by a speed slider that controls
   the slideshow playback speed. When the slider is to the far left, slideshow
   speed is 0.25Hz and when to the far right, the slideshow plays without any
   delay between frames.

 * Added separate visibility and color options for display of feature tracks
   that have descriptors and those that do not have descriptors.  This allows
   for visual distinction between KLT tracks (without descriptors) on each
   frame of video and ORB, or similar, tracks (with descriptors) on keyframes.

 * Added a progress bar that appears below the World View to show progress when
   tools are running.  It can also display a status message.
   
 * Added CMake superbuild to automatically pull and build a specified version of all 
   the necessary libraries from Fletch and KWIVER. This allows MAP-Tk to be fully built
   from a single build, rather than having to manually build and connect multiple builds.
   The superbuild does still allow using a manually built KWIVER/Fletch if so desired.
 

 * Added ability to interactively add and edit a region of interest in the
   world view.

 * Added ability to specify image masks.  Currently these are supported by
   dense feature tracking.
