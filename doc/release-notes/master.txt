MAP-Tk v0.11.0 Release Notes
============================

This is a minor release of MAP-Tk that provides both new functionality and
fixes over the previous v0.10.0 release.


Updates since v0.10.0
--------------------

Overall

 * Removed all uses of VITAL_FOREACH, which has been removed from KWIVER,
   and replace with standard C++11 range-based for loops.

 * Updated everything to use the new feature_track_set class and
   feature_track_state class from KWIVER.  The previous data structure,
   track_set is now a base class and is generalized to support other types of
   tracks, like moving object tracks.

 * Replaced use of the geo_map vital algorithm with the new geodetic conversion
   functions and data structures provided in KWIVER.  The new approach still
   uses plugins (e.g. PROJ4) but only supports one backend at a time that is
   globally accessible throughout KWIVER.  There is no more need to explicitly
   pass a geo_map object around.  New data structures, like geo_point, know
   how to convert themselves into different coordinate systems.

MAP-Tk Library

 * modified extract_feature_colors API to accept a feature_track_set by
   shared_ptr, modify to tracks in-place, and return the same modifed
   feature_track_set.  It also uses the new track_set API to more quickly
   find track state on a frame and avoids destroying the frame index if
   one is used in the track_set.

Plugins

 * Moved the Blender and SketchUp plugins out of the scripts directory and
   into a top-level plugins directory, added a README, and configured these
   files to be installed.

 * The SketchUp plugin now supports older version of SketchUp
   (back to version 8) and only attempts to load frames which have both an
   image file and camera file available in the project.

TeleSculptor

 * Updated the TeleSculptor application to build against VTK 8.0 instead of
   VTK 6.2.  This upgrade provides substantial improvements to rendering
   speed of large data sets.

 * Changed frame indexing to be one-based rather than zero-based.  This change
   was needed since the new streaming video API used in the tracking tools now
   produces frames with one-based indexing.  Track files produced with older
   versions that had zero-based indexing are detected and frame numbers are
   shifted by one.

 * Video files can now be open directly or via a config file into TeleSculptor
   for viewing and processing.

 * Added the concept of a "Project", which is essentially a configuration file
   in a working directory in which algorithms can write results.  The user
   must now create or open a project before running an algorithms.

 * TeleSculptor now depends on Sprokit from KWIVER and adds a new Sprokit
   powered compute tool compute feature tracks using the new KLT feature
   tracker in KWIVER.  The tool also detects key frames in video and uses
   ORB feature detection and matching on the keyframes with bag of words
   frame matching for loop closure.

 * A new tool is available in the compute menu to compute a dense depth
   map on the current frame.  THis uses the new Super3D algorithms in KWIVER.

 * TeleSculptor now supports logging with log4cplus.

 * If an input video has KLV metadata (0601 or 0104) TeleSculptor will now
   parse that metadata and use it to construct initial camera models.  It will
   also use the metadata to set a geographic origin for the project, which is
   written to the project directory.

 * TeleSculptor now has a pair of new tools in the Compute menu to save out
   either keyframes or all frames of video to image files.

 * TeleSculptor now uses a common convention for naming all output files
   supporting a frame of video.  If the input is an image list it uses the
   source image names, if a video it uses video name plus frame number.

 * TeleSculptor now has a new tool for triangulating landmarks.  This is
   useful when cameras are provided (e.g. from metadata), but landmarks are
   not.

 * TeleSculptor now supports loading and processing videos with increasing
   but non contiguous frame numbers.  This may occur when loading a video
   at a reduced frame rate.

 * TeleSculptor now has an option to display only keyframes when playing
   back a video.

 * The compute menu has been rearranged and now has an "Advanced" submenu
   containing tool that are less stable or less commonly used.


Fixes since v0.10.0
------------------

Installer

 * Fixed an issue where required data files for PROJ were not installed.
   This also requires TeleSculptor and the command line tools to set an
   environment variable to tell PROJ where the data is installed.

TeleSculptor

 * TeleSculptor now catches more algorithm exceptions and turns them into
   warning messages rather than letting the application crash.

Tests

 * All of the unit tests in v0.10.0 were testing functions that had moved
   into KWIVER.  Those tests had also been duplicated in KWIVER, so the
   redundant tests in MAP-Tk were removed.  This leaves MAP-Tk with no tests.
   New tests, especially for the command line tools, should be added in the
   future.
