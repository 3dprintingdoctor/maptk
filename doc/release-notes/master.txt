MAP-Tk v0.11.0 Release Notes
============================

This is a minor release of MAP-Tk that provides both new functionality and
fixes over the previous v0.10.0 release.


Updates since v0.10.0
--------------------

Overall

 * Removed all uses of VITAL_FOREACH, which has been removed from KWIVER,
   and replace with standard C++11 range-based for loops.

 * Updated everything to use the new feature_track_set class and
   feature_track_state class from KWIVER.  The previous data structure,
   track_set is now a base class and is generalized to support other types of
   tracks, like moving object tracks.

 * Replaced use of the geo_map vital algorithm with the new geodetic conversion
   functions and data structures provided in KWIVER.  The new approach still
   uses plugins (e.g. PROJ4) but only supports one backend at a time that is
   globally accessible throughout KWIVER.  There is no more need to explicitly
   pass a geo_map object around.  New data structures, like geo_point, know
   how to convert themselves into different coordinate systems.

TeleSculptor

 * Updated the TeleSculptor application to build against VTK 8.0 instead of
   VTK 6.2.  This upgrade provides substantial improvements to rendering
   speed of large data sets.

MAP-Tk Library

 * modified extract_feature_colors API to accept a feature_track_set by
   shared_ptr, modify to tracks in-place, and return the same modifed
   feature_track_set.  It also uses the new track_set API to more quickly
   find track state on a frame and avoids destroying the frame index if
   one is used in the track_set.


Fixes since v0.10.0
------------------

Tests

 * All of the unit tests in v0.10.0 were testing functions that had moved
   into KWIVER.  Those tests had also been duplicated in KWIVER, so the
   redundant tests in MAP-Tk were removed.  This leaves MAP-Tk with no tests.
   New tests, especially for the command line tools, should be added in the
   future.
